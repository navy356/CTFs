Hello Class. Welcome to the fundamentals of version control

Git is a very functional and highly useful tool that is used by millions of people from around the world everyday. It allows one to add and keep track of files and their entire history in a decentralized manner. But, for as useful as the program is, it does contain a lot of idiosyncracies to it, that can make it very confusing to both beginners and veterans alike. Stuff like broken commands, allowing for unaccounted objects without an index, arcane commands kept around only for the sake of backwards compatibility, it can be a nightmare to navigate through.

Oh, well. Looks like that's all the time we have. So, explore this and we'll meet again soon
